PETE * #1-Polyethylene Terephthalate - The easiest plastic to recycle and most commonly found in plastic water(soda) bottles and some food packaging. PETE is commonly recycled into fibers or polar fleece. It is not recommended for reuse which means it ends up in the recycling stream quickly.
HDPE * #2 – High Density Polyethylene - This kind of plastic is usually colored or opaque and can be found in milk jugs and detergent or household cleaner bottles. HDPE can easily be recycled into plastic lumber, more bottles or drainage pipes and is considered one of the safest forms of plastic.
PVC * #3 – Polyvinyl Chloride - Found in shampoo bottles, medical plastics, some toys (including dog) and window trim, this plastic is typically not used for household items that can be consumed as it can contain phthalates. PVC is usually recycled into paneling, flooring, cables and decks.
LDPE * #4 – Low Density Polyethylene - Bottles you can squeeze like shampoo or condiment bottles are made from LDPE. A lot of recycling centers do not accept LDPE but Hebron's does! (this does NOT include plastic film) LDPE can be recycled into more bags or trash liners and floor tiles.
PP * #5 – Polypropylene - PP is durable and versatile. This is usually found in medical bottles, yogurt tubs, cereal box liners, bottle caps, some ropes and condiment bottles. PP can be recycled into brushes, battery cases and bike racks.
PS * #6 – Polystyrene - Commonly referred to as 'styrofoam' this is the one kind of plastic that is NOT accepted at the Hebron Transfer Station. Styrofoam makes up Dunkin' cups (for hot liquids), meat trays, packing peanuts and egg cartons.
OTHER * #7 – BPA, Lexan etc. - This is a mixed bag of plastics. It includes things like baby bottles and 5 gallon water jugs. If you're not sure whether or not your plastic can be recycled just drop us a line or stop by the Hebron Transfer Station!
